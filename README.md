# Dibetes prediction model and other data science tasks

## Description 
This is a data science project. Here I have used scikit learn library and matlpotlib to analyse the data about from different datasets and make predictions on it using classifiers. 

qn2 and qn1 - here I have analysed the datasets using various plots and histograms bofore building the classifier
qn3 - here I have analysed and compared the performance of three different classifiers implemented vy scikit learn (naive bayes, knn and decision tree)
qn4 - here I have dived into statisitcs and the Bayes theorem (only formulas, no code)
