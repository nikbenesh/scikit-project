Behind the scenes, it's applying a statistical method called *density estimation* to create the plot; density estimation is something we will see more of in the course.  Pandas calls functions in MatPlotLib to create the plot; you could use MatPlotLib to enhance the plot, adding a title, or axis labels, etc.  No, not today.  When you need to impress someone with a good graphic.\n",
