A NDArray stores numerical data much more efficiently than Python lists, and its methods are optimized for array-level tasks.  The powerful thing about Numpy is that you can express array-level calculations with simple algebraic expressions, and usually without loops.  The Numpy module also provides very useful libraries for array-based and matric-based computations."
